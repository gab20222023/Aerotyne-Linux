# Aerotyne-Linux
My journey building a custom Linux distribution from scratch.

Yo, what's up! I'm just starting out with Linux and learned a bit of the basics. The reason I am creating a linux distro from scratch is so I can learn everything about linux and the internals of it.
So please don't expect a professional sitting here making an entire linux distro, I'm just experimenting as a beginner, just so you know :)

So how will I aproach this massive project? By following the LFS (linux from scratch) guide online.
